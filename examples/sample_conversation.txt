Speaker A: It's—oh, that was Beth.
Provider: How are you?
Speaker A: Good. How are you?
Provider: Good. I appreciate you letting me come.
Speaker A: I'm actually glad you came because she's had a lot of problems with swelling in her feet and legs.
Provider: She's been calling it swelling?
Speaker A: I could call it a blister.
Provider: A blister?
Speaker A: Yeah. Swelling. I don't know why her feet are so swollen. Has she been up sitting a lot during the day?
Provider: The only thing I can think of is having them down, not elevated.
Speaker A: They really didn't start swelling until yesterday. But it looks like it's more the right than the left. It is more that than this one. I think it's worse, but I don't know if that is blister.
Provider: I don't know if it's swelling or if it's because of the shoes. Definitely don't just let it do its thing. Is she on any kind of fluid pill or anything?
Speaker A: She is.
Provider: I don't see anything. I'm just going to look at her legs and make sure there's not any red or hot spots or anything. With her being on a blood thinner, it's less likely she's got a blood clot, but I'm going to take a look.
Provider: First of all, that's where you had your leg hanging over.
Speaker A: She was just doing that. She's actually been doing that.
Provider: I think that's where it lands.
Speaker C: Russia and China have not tested nuclear weapons…
Provider: That's really red right there. My big concern is a blood clot.
Speaker A: But like I said, with her being on the blood thinner it's a lot less likely. I can't tell if this redness is because of it rubbing somewhere. That's more what it looks like.
Provider: It looks like irritation, like it's been sitting somewhere.
Speaker A: She's up more today, but she normally hasn't really been in the bed a lot.
Provider: I would say for sure we need to make sure she's propped when she's laying down and sitting up. I would like to let the doctor know she's got all this swelling. When did you notice it start?
Speaker A: I think last month when I noticed the blister. She kept complaining about her legs. I didn't really notice the swelling until yesterday.
Provider: This one's just around the ankle.
Speaker A: It looks like a blood blister.
Provider: I'll let the doctor know and see what they think. She might need a little bit of a diuretic to get the fluid off.
Speaker A: I'm waiting on her primary doctor to call me back. They couldn't see her until November 18, which was too far for a hospital follow-up. They offered 9 in the morning, but she's still very weak and I'm not sure I can get her in the car.
Provider: I'll call them too.
Provider: You want some socks?
Speaker A: I don't know, but okay.
Provider: I'm going to get her vital signs while I'm here.
Speaker A: Her blood pressure was 119 over 56 this morning.
Provider: Do you feel short of breath at all?
Speaker B: No.
Provider: Oxygen is 95. How is your pain level right now?
Speaker B: Not now. My feet were hurting earlier.
Provider: They feel a little better now?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Provider: She looks like she's using abdominal muscles to breathe. I wonder if she's retaining fluid, possibly related to heart failure. Weight would help, but I know that's hard.
Speaker A: She was supposed to have an echo and stress test, but she was in the hospital for the first appointment and just got home.
Provider: That would be high priority.
Speaker A: She's been breathing harder than usual, but I thought it was because her feet were hurting.
Provider: It may just be something I'm noticing since I don't see her as often, but it's worth keeping an eye on.
Speaker A: She's also always been fidgety.
Provider: Have they ever mentioned tardive dyskinesia?
Speaker A: I think they did in the hospital, but neurology never really diagnosed it.
Provider: That fits with what I'm seeing—especially the mouth movements. Some mood medications can cause that. It might be worth discussing medication changes.
Speaker A: She has narcolepsy too. She can fall asleep sitting at the table.
Provider: I haven't been around many people with that.
Speaker A: She's had it a long time.
Provider: If anything changes, text or call me. I'll follow up with therapy about increasing visits.
